# Quake Timer CLI

I like playing Quake and decided I would make a way that lets me record my times on the command line.


It uses javascripts file system and readline to record times in files from the command line.
Pretty basic, but a fun little project. 


I had set out taking screenshots with Nightmare but decided that was no good so a CLI was my second idea. There are many better tools out there, but this one is mine :)
